### To Successfully Run the program you must make a database that can be accsessible anywhere in the world, Some good providers of these are AWS, Google Clound and Digital Ocean, But you may also be able to find some free ones. Once you have a database you must create your table and column in my case i named both onoff but you can name it whatever you want just be sure to change it in the code. After that set up the wiring on your Raspberry Pi and run main.py on your pi, then run the Web App on your favorite Hosting service in my case I used Heroku but you may use whatever is best for you. and Voila you can now close any circuit from anywhere in the world by just going to your website.
